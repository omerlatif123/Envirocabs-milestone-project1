### What is the purpose? 

The company wants the website to be simple and visually attractive to its customers. They also want website viewers to be given the opportunity to quickly book a cab or download their app with ease through the website. This is the overall goal of the company to have new and existing customers to book cabs.  Envirocabs has also stated that they want to further expand their social media presence and therefore this must be highlighted on their website, to allow website visitors to access their Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Snap chat.  

Our client is Envirocabs a start-up minicab office that is environmentally friendly. All Envirocabs vehicles are 100% electric and produce 0% omissions. The client wants to highlight this on their website as an environmentally friendly alternative to its competitors. Furthermore, the company believes there is a niche in the market to attract those aiming to reduce their carbon footprint but still require cabs to travel. The company wants to attract new customers as its innovative and literally a breath of fresh air from its polluting competitors. Envirocabs wants us to also highlight the environmental initiatives to further bolster their public image.

## Skeleton

Wireframe mockups were created in a Balsamic with our clients and potential visitors goal in mind.
Images section in the wireframes have been higlighted in blue, this was previously due to the images from the wireframe being different from the completed website. 
Furthermore the images used on the final Envirocabs website are free to use images causing no copyright/royalty payment concerns. Some of the images from the wireframes may not have been copyright/royalty free and therefore the imagess have bee covered as a precaution.

# Design

### Colour Scheme
The two main colours used are Blue and White as these colours compliment the Envirocabs logo. The colour concept is blue because this is associated with the colour of electricity this relates to our vehicles being 100% electric. White was used as a contrast to blue and gives the website a simplistic but professional and sytlish look. The website should look appealing but should allow the customer to focus on the content rather than to visually distracted by an array of colours.
Green was picked for the Our Commitment page in which we the client wanted to highlight their green initiatives and procedures Envirocabs is implementing to go greener. Environment is associated with green and therefore we wanted this to be highlight. All other webpages have blue text, but Our Commitment page has green text. The sudden colour change will draw the attention of the user when they are on this page.   

 #### Colours used in website background and text.

- ![#fff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fff/000000?text=+) **White** (#fff),

#### Typography
The headers on all pages throughout the Website and main text is using the font ‘Roboto’ with default text of ‘San-Serif’. The header text and parts of the main text are bold catching the user’s eye. We have kept our content at a minimal not to make our website cluttered or causing the user cognitive overload with large amount of information text. Furthermore when researching other cab webpages such as uber,bolt etc have minimalistic content.

#### Imagery
Brand awareness is important to Envirocabs and they have requested their own Logo to be used in the Nav section of the website. The header contains the Envirocabs logo which has been designed and created on www.wix.com. (https://www.wix.com/logo/maker/esh). The logo is interactive and when clicked will redirect the user back to the home page.   
The images used are all related to section of the website the user is on, for example in the safety section the hero image is of a car interior being cleaned. The imagery chosen fits well within the theme of the webpage as they relate to the subject matter. The imagery used is also visually striking without being overbearing on the rest of the webpage.

- Contact Form - This can be completed on the contact us page and used to book a cab. Brief information is required from the user/customer to complete the form. If any information is missing the form will specify. 

#
## Differences to Design

In the original design, the booking button and download our app link was in the footer even when reduced to mobile device size. Current design the section is hidden when reduced to a smaller size this something that should be rectified in the future. The reason why this section is hidden when website is reduced in size is because the footer looks cluttered and visually unappealing. 

Features left to implement in the future

Have google maps embed in the contact us page showing the location of Envirocabs head office. Currently having issues embedding maps on smaller devices therefore omitted it from web page. Will attempt to resolve when there is less of a time constraint. 

Email confirmation and text confirmation of when booking form is completed by user/customer. Currently unable to as webpage is static and Javascript has not been applied.   

Have an interactive chatbot on the website that can answer certain queries such as providing user/customers with price quotes of journeys. This is currently difficult and will require further research and expenditure to implement.    

# Issues and bugs encountered
As a developed I encountered various problems throughout which I have resolved or learned to work around. 

<strong>Gitpod</strong>- One of the biggest issues I encountered was my own lack of understanding of my developer tools. While working on my project previously on Gitpod I would only git commit my messages assuming everything was being saved, how wrong I was. Its during my second mentor meeting that my mentor examined my code and commits to realise no messages had been saved. I was incorrectly only git committing messages, but I had not used git add before, so the message was never registered correctly. 
During my second mentor meeting because of my failure to register messages correctly, Gitpod had 79 unsaved changes after a failed attempt to save the page, I was advised to restart my project. I opened another Github repository and have been git adding, committing, and pushing my work correctly. This was an issue for me as I had to restart my project and had wasted time, but it is something I have resolved with the help of my mentor and viewing and understanding the code institution videos clearer. 
This has helped me develop good practises as a developer for future projects so every time I use Gitpod I always add and commit messages correctly and I git push, so I have a copy of my code on GitHub, had to reschedule a mentor meeting because no work had been pushed onto Github and Gtpod had stopped responding on the day of the meeting. Overcoming this challenge has made me more comfortable as a developer.

<strong>Navbar menu toggler</strong>- When implementing a navbar menu toggle for when the page is viewed smaller devices the navbar I had already created would not allow me to implement the toggle. When adding the code for menu toggler to my existing code my headers on my navbar for larger screens would shift position and any padding applied would be lost. After researching these issues and asking fellow developers on slack that I discovered the solution. I had to completely restructure my navbar code and start over. The Navbar I have created now is a lot more responsive although slightly different my appearance to the previous navbar, changes to a hamburger toggle when web page size is reduced. 

<strong>Webpage responsiveness</strong>- When creating my webpage originally, I did not implement mobile first design approach, the Envirocabs webpage looked visually appealing on bigger screens but when reduced in size and when page responsiveness was tested on other devices the page layout would shift, creating inconsistencies in the design. Both images and text would go out of position or merge within each other. To address this issue further research was done into website breakpoints and responsive design. I was advised by my mentor during our meeting to grasp a better understanding of this area. Websites such as W3schools.com and others helped rectify the issue as it helped to create a better understanding of device responsiveness. For smaller devices, the standard breakpoint of small was not sufficient and therefore XS was applied. 

<strong>Envirocab Logo</strong>- A bug was detected in the navigation bar, the Envirocab logo when clicked should have redirected the user back to the home page.  When applying code to the other headings on the navbar they became responsive. The other navbar headers were responsive and when clicked would redirect the user but the Envirocabs logo when clicked was not. 
Both Slack and researching to resolve this issue took considerable amount of time but did not resolve the problem. Instead, I began using dev tools to look at existing websites and what techniques they had used to make their logos responsive when clicked. The AA website when viewing inspecting its code in dev tools, I realised how they had made their AA logo responsive when clicked redirected user back to the home page. I applied the same method do my open code without also copying theirs and it worked. 

<strong>Fixed Header</strong>- Created a fixed header as discussed with my mentor, had issues with creating it as the navbar would disappear when amending its CSS position to fixed. Resolved issue when using dev tools, the hero images and other images position was set at relative, in dev tools I removed this position from the images and the footer became fixed. Now header is fixed in all pages and when scrolling down the page remains in place.  

<strong>Hero images</strong>- issue with quality of free images online, replaced images with higher quality ones as on other devices images looked grainy and blurred.   
 

<strong>Overflow issues</strong>- when using website on any devices there was a gap being created so advise from students on slack to use unicorn revealer to work out where overflow is on the page, then I used dev tools to work out what was causing problem released some container margin-right and left were set at 15px when I corrected this to 0px for both, this resolved the issue and the overflow disappeared.
